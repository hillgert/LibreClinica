# T040: rule management
**Abstract:**  
This document contains the definitions for tests that concern the management of rules. Rules are used for validation, showing or hiding items, sending mails and scheduling events.  
Rules are referred to by rule-IDs and rules that have the same item as target are grouped as a rule-set with a rule-set-ID.  
This document doesn't apply to correct functioning of the rules: this is tested elsewhere.
